This is a simple demo for the object tracking.
Author: Bin Zhao
Character:imhist of the frame for all rgb channel.
Fitness value: the inside-angle between two vector(model vector and observe vector)
Model update: update after each frame(due to the connectivy of two frame)
Reason of imhist: 
	The most important target is to get the fitness value quickly.
	Then imhist is the summation of each pixel. So we could do initially to keep the 2d-presummation.
	And each calculation of the fitness value take O(3*t) rather then O(H*W) this is a real improvement.

Not finish:
	1) calculate the value by brute force.
	2) do not satisified with multiple object tracking.
